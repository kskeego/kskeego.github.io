We spread the cheese all the way to the edges for the caramelized frico crust, then finish with warm sauce on top after the bake. It\u2019s the same style I remember from back home, now shared here in Edmond and the OKC metro."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do you have vegan options?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "We never want anyone to feel left out because of their diet. That\u2019s why we offer vegan cheese, plant-based meats, and fresh, in-house cut veggies so you can build a pizza that fits your lifestyle. We even create the occasional Vegan Pizza of the Month to keep things exciting and make sure all of our guests feel taken care of."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do you have dairy-free options?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes \u2014 we know how important dairy-free choices are, and for us it\u2019s personal. When our daughter was a newborn, she had a minor dairy allergy, so we understand the need firsthand. At Woodward Pizza we offer dairy-free cheese and plenty of fresh toppings, and many of our pizzas can be customized into a dairy-free pizza without losing any of the flavor. Our goal is to make sure everyone \u2014 whether you\u2019re local to Edmond or visiting the OKC metro \u2014 can enjoy a great slice together."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do you have gluten-free options?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes \u2014 and this one is close to our hearts. I spent over 9 months researching and developing our gluten-free dough, determined to make it almost indistinguishable from our standard Detroit-style pizza. The result is light, fluffy, crisp, and deep \u2014 just like the square pizzas I grew up on. Our original business partner has celiac disease, and when he tried it for the first time he told me it was the best gluten-free pizza he\u2019d ever had. To go with it, we also keep gluten-free cider on tap and carry gluten-free beer. In our kitchen we take extra precautions: a separate mixer for gluten-free dough, different pans, and we prepare the dough later in the day so regular flour dust has time to settle. While we can\u2019t guarantee a completely flour-free environment, we do everything possible to minimize cross-contact and create a safe, delicious option for guests with gluten sensitivity."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do you have a full bar?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes \u2014 Woodward Pizza has a full bar that\u2019s all about bringing people together.

Our cinnamon sticks come with house-made orange icing and can even be ordered gluten-free. We rotate seasonal flavors of freshly churned gelato, including dairy-free options, and we hand-fill our classic cannolis. And for the grown-ups, we say a well-crafted cocktail can count as dessert too \u2014 our bar team always has something seasonal to sip alongside your square."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do you take reservations?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Our pizzeria is a small, community space, so we stay first-come, first-served to keep it fair and relaxed for everyone. For larger groups, there\u2019s an event space right next to our back door called The Stables at Icehouse. We can connect you with their team and provide catering so your whole group can enjoy our Detroit-style pizza together."}}, {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is Woodward Pizza kid-friendly?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes \u2014 we\u2019re family-owned, and our own kids are often around helping out when they\u2019re not in school.

We want Woodward Pizza to be more than just dinner \u2014 it\u2019s a fun family outing.
