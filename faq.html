<details><summary><strong>What makes your pizza Detroit-style?</strong></summary><p>We bake in seasoned steel pans for a light, airy interior and crispy, caramelized edges (frico). Sauce goes on top after the bake, and we cut it into squares — just like back home in Detroit, where even rectangles are called “square pizza.”</p></details>
<details><summary><strong>Why do Detroiters call it “square” if it’s rectangular?</strong></summary><p>It’s a Detroit thing — the pies are baked in rectangular pans, but the style has always been called “square.” Order a square, get a rectangle, and everyone’s happy.</p></details>
<details><summary><strong>Do you do the racing stripes on top?</strong></summary><p>We finish with warm sauce on top after the bake (true red-top style), but we don’t always do the classic racing stripes. Same Detroit flavor, just our own presentation.</p></details>
<details><summary><strong>Do you have vegan or dairy-free options?</strong></summary><p>Yes. We never want anyone to feel left out: we offer vegan cheese, plant-based meats, and fresh-cut, in-house veggies. We even run the occasional vegan Pizza of the Month so everyone has something they love.</p></details>
<details><summary><strong>Do you have gluten-free pizza?</strong></summary><p>We spent months dialing in a gluten-free dough that eats a lot like our standard squares — light, fluffy, crisp, and satisfying. We use a separate mixer, make GF dough later in the day to let more flour dust settle, and bake in dedicated pans. We’re still a pizzeria (flour is in the building), so we can’t guarantee zero cross-contact, but we work hard to minimize it. We also offer gluten-free cider on tap and GF beer options.</p></details>
<details><summary><strong>What about dessert?</strong></summary><p>Cinnamon sticks with our house-made orange icing (GF available), hand-filled cannoli, and rotating gelato — including dairy-free flavors. Pro tip: order a side of cannoli cream to dip your cinnamon sticks. And yes, a great cocktail counts as dessert too.</p></details>
<details><summary><strong>Do you serve slices or have lunch specials?</strong></summary><p>Yes. We rotate slices and weekday lunch combos like slice-and-half-salad, salad-and-meatballs, and more. Availability varies — check in-store and online. A 4-square cheese is also a perfect kid-size dinner today and tomorrow’s lunch.</p></details>
<details><summary><strong>Can I order from the patio?</strong></summary><p>Absolutely. If the line looks long, grab a patio table, scan the QR code, pick your table number, and we’ll run your order out. Great for blind dates, parents on kid-watch, or anyone in “I need pizza now” mode.</p></details>
<details><summary><strong>Can I order from American Solera and still get the pizza?</strong></summary><p>Yep. Scan the QR code on your table at American Solera, order through our menu, and we’ll bring the pizza to you.</p></details>
<details><summary><strong>Do you host large groups or parties?</strong></summary><p>We’re cozy and first-come, first-served, but we can connect you with The Stables at Icehouse next door. We don’t manage the venue or set it up, but we can cater the pizza for your team, office, or birthday squad — yes, even the whole football team.</p></details>
<details><summary><strong>Do you take reservations?</strong></summary><p>Seating is first-come, first-served. For bigger gatherings, ask us about connecting with The Stables next door.</p></details>
<details><summary><strong>Are you family-friendly?</strong></summary><p>Very. We have high chairs, the courtyard is spacious, and kids love the giant green grasshopper climbing structure. Please help us keep it fun by preventing any jailbreaks or rock-tossing — at windows or each other 😉.</p></details>
<details><summary><strong>Do you have a kids’ menu?</strong></summary><p>Every pizza can be a kids’ meal! A 4-square cheese is our go-to recommendation: easy dinner now, leftover lunch tomorrow.</p></details>
<details><summary><strong>Do you have a full bar or happy hour?</strong></summary><p>Yes — full bar with cocktails and beer, and two happy hours Monday–Friday: 2–6 pm and 8:30–10 pm.</p></details>
<details><summary><strong>Where do I park?</strong></summary><p>Use the Icehouse Project lot or nearby street parking; you can also walk from the farmers market lot. Even if the lot looks full, the patio usually has open seats.</p></details>
<details><summary><strong>Can I order online?</strong></summary><p>Yes — and our online menu often has more options than the in-store board. Think of it as a little cheat-code secret menu.</p></details>
<details><summary><strong>Where are you and what are your hours?</strong></summary><p>We’re at 119 W 2nd St, Suite 100, Edmond, OK. See current hours and a Google Map on our Hours & Contact page.</p></details>
